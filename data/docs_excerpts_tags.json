Specifically, while the lower frequencies generated by the turbine would almost certainly result in complex, three-dimensional variations in received levels, noise would also be generated in the 1-3 kHz range. It is reasonable to expect that the conclusions about acoustic transmission at 10 kHz may be extended to sounds in the 1-3 kHz range. If the radial variations in received levels of turbine noise in these bands are well-aligned with the results from the source test, then this would suggest that a turbine acts as an omni-directional source. To the extent different patterns emerge, these may stem from source directivity. Accurate assumptions regarding source directivity and propagation directivity are essential for making accurate pre-installation estimates of received levels of turbine noise for other projects.",

The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether the performance observed in a laboratory setting (at 1:4 scale) for closely-spaced cross-flow turbines are representative of unconfined field conditions. In the second, a single cross-flow turbine would be mounted to the vessel and used to evaluate the capabilities of an integrated instrumentation system to detect collisions with small objects (for example, neutrally buoyant floats).",
