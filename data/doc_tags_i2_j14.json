Specifically, while the lower frequencies generated by the turbine would almost certainly result in complex, three-dimensional variations in received levels, noise would also be generated in the 1-3 kHz range. It is reasonable to expect that the conclusions about acoustic transmission at 10 kHz may be extended to sounds in the 1-3 kHz range. If the radial variations in received levels of turbine noise in these bands are well-aligned with the results from the source test, then this would suggest that a turbine acts as an omni-directional source. To the extent different patterns emerge, these may stem from source directivity. Accurate assumptions regarding source directivity and propagation directivity are essential for making accurate pre-installation estimates of received levels of turbine noise for other projects.",

Additionally, larger vessels transit the lake, such as NOAA vessel mobilizing from facilities at Sand Point, on the western shore. The presence two additional research vessels (one to deploy and recovery the mooring, the other to collect data from the camera system) are unlikely to have any incremental effect on ESA-listed species.",

Similarly to fresh water testing, artificial lighting at this depth may result in short-term, temporary attraction or avoidance behavior by aquatic species. The duration of this illumination would be, at most, a total of 24 hours over four days, with continuous illumination occurring for no longer than four hours at a time. Consequently, attraction or avoidance would be temporary and is not anticipated to be of biological significance for ESA-listed species.",
