Background and History\r\nThe purpose of this Biological Evaluation (BE) is to address the effect that the field of testing of the Adaptable Monitoring Package (AMP) and its associated deployment system might have on species listed as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) or their designated critical habitat. The United States Department of Energy (DOE) is proposing to allow expenditure of federal funds (Proposed Action) by Oregon State University (OSU) and its sub-recipient, the University of Washington (UW) for the project described herein (Project) and seeks concurrence from the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USDFW) that the Project will not affect ESA-listed species or their designated critical habitat.\r\nThe Northwest National Marine Renewable Energy (NNMREC) is a DOE-funded partnership between OSU and UW with a goal of facilitating the responsible commercialization of marine renewable energy in the United States. In conjunction with other research activities, NNMREC is developing the Pacific Marine Energy Center (PMEC) to enable testing of wave and tidal energy converter device performance and environmental interactions. PMEC includes the South Energy Test Site (SETS) a grid-connected, wave energy test facility that will be the first facility of its kind in North America. \r\nA portion of the DOE funding for PMEC will be utilized to develop and test an Adaptable Monitoring Package (AMP) for monitoring environmental interactions (Proposed Action). The AMP consists of a streamlined instrumentation package for studying environmental interactions around wave and tidal energy converters. The AMP is deployed from a surface vessel by a Remotely Operated Vehicle. Because these studies will be conducted with financial support from DOE, the Proposed Action is subject to the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). However, the Proposed Action may qualify for a NEPA categorical exclusion (CX) under 10 CFR Part 1021, section B5.25 Small Scale Renewable Energy Research and Pilot Projects in Aquatic Environments (see Federal Register Vol. 776, No. 198 at p. 63797), provided that it will not affect ESA-listed species or their designated critical habitat.\r\nIn-water testing of the AMP would be carried out in two locations: Lake Washington and Admiralty Inlet, as shown in Figure 1. Because work would occur in the aquatic environment it has the potential to impact the following ESA-listed marine species that are known to occur in the area: marbled murrelet, Chinook salmon, chum salmon, steelhead, bull trout, green sturgeon, bocaccio, canary rockfish, yellow rockfish, Pacific eulachon, humpback whales, Southern Resident killer whales, Stellar sea lions and designated critical habitat for several of these ESA-listed species. Marbled murrelet and bull trout are a trust resource for the US Fish and Wildlife Service (USFSW). All other ESA-listed species are a trust resource for the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS).", "tags": ["Receptor.Birds", "Receptor.Fish", "Receptor.Marine Mammals", "Receptor.HumanDimensions", "Phase.1SiteCharacterizationandAssessment", "Management.NoneIdentified", "Consequence.Injury", "Consequence.Mortality", "Stressor.Noise"]},

The use of this type of package has been supported by both agencies as an effective tool for studying the environmental effects of marine renewable energy development. A complete description of regulatory meetings related to the Snohomish PUD/OpenHydro demonstration project is presented in Snohomish PUD (2012).\r\nThis BE addresses DOE\u2019s proposed Action to provide federal funding to the proposed Project in compliance with Section 7(c) of the ESA of 1973, as amended. Section 7 of the ESA assures that, through consultation (or conferencing for proposed species) with NMFS and/or USFWS, federal actions do not jeopardize the continued existence of any threatened, endangered or proposed species, or result in the destruction or adverse modification of critical habitat.\r\nThe objective of the proposed Project is to test deployment and recovery of the AMP in benign conditions (Lake Washington) and adverse conditions (Admiralty Inlet), to verify its capabilities to support monitoring around wave and tidal current energy projects. The AMP is an enabling technology for monitoring of renewable energy projects in aquatic environment and a piece of critical infrastructure for PMEC.\r\n________________\r\n2. Description of the Project Activities and Project Areas\r\nThe two proposed project areas associated with Adaptable Monitoring Package (AMP) testing are described in the following subsections. Lake Washington constitutes a benign testing environment (i.e., limited wave and current action), whereas Admiralty Inlet constitutes an adverse testing environment (i.e., moderate wave and current action). The AMP is not intended for deployment or recovery in strong wave or current action, but may operate in these environments.\r\nThe AMP and deployment system consists of five major components, as shown in Figure 2, Figure 3, and Figure 4:\r\n* The Adaptable Monitoring Package (AMP), a custom-designed, streamlined instrumentation frame supporting environmental monitoring sensors. These sensors require a shore power and data connection and would not be activated during testing. Once docked, the AMP connects to shore power and data via a hybrid electrical-optical wet-mate connector (\u201csocket\u201d on the docking station, \u201cplug\u201d on the AMP).\r\n* An inspection-class Remotely Operated Vehicle (SAAB SeaEye Falcon ROV) connected to a surface vessel by a power and data umbilical.\r\n* A custom-designed tool skid to augment the thrust of the inspection-class ROV and allow mating with a docking station (\u201cMillennium\u201d tool skid).\r\n* A docking station for the AMP. For operational deployments with a tidal or wave energy converter, the docking station would be incorporated into the converter structure, as shown in Figure 3. For testing, the docking station will be incorporated into a test platform, as shown in Figure 4.\r\n* A launch platform used to position the AMP and ROV at docking station depth. This reduces drag forces on the ROV umbilical (i.e., drag on the portion of the umbilical between platform depth and surface vessel are absorbed by a load-bearing umbilical terminated at the launch platform, rather than being applied directly to the ROV).", "tags": ["Phase.1SiteCharacterizationandAssessment", "Phase.2Construction", "Phase.3OperationsandMaintenance", "Technology.Current", "Technology.OTEC", "Technology.Current.OceanCurrent", "Technology.Current.Riverine", "Technology.SalinityGradient", "Technology.Current.Tidal", "Technology.Wave", "Technology.OffshoreWind", "Technology.OffshoreWind.Fixed", "Technology.OffshoreWind.Floating", "Receptor.PhysicalEnvironment", "Receptor.PhysicalEnvironment.SedimentTransport", "Receptor.PhysicalEnvironment.WaterQuality", "Management.Compliance", "Management.DesignFeature", "Management.Mitigation", "Management.Monitoring", "Management.NoneIdentified"]},

ROV mates the AMP with docking station.\r\n6. ROV disengages from AMP and is recovered to the surface vessel. The AMP remains clamped to the docking station.\r\n7. The ROV and launch platform are recovered to the research vessel. (This would be the end point for AMP deployment in an operational scenario around a wave or tidal converter equipped with a docking station.)\r\n8. The AMP is recovered to the surface via an acoustic release. This would be the process for AMP recovery in an operational scenario and would occur several months after AMP deployment, but will occur shortly after the launch platform is recovered during testing.\r\n9.

        {"file_name": "AMP Biological Evaluation REV1.02", "text_excerpt": "Of these threatened and endangered species, Admiralty Inlet is included in the critical habitat for Chinook salmon and chum salmon (to a depth of 30 m, NMFS 2005b), and Southern Resident killer whales (NMFS 2006b). Lake Washington and the ship canal adjacent to the University of Washington dock are designated as critical habitat for Chinook salmon (NOAA 2005b) and bull trout (USFWS 2010).\r\n________________\r\n4. Environmental Baseline Conditions\r\nLake Washington and the ship canal adjacent to the University of Washington dock (Figure 6) are fresh-water, urbanized waterways located within the Seattle metropolitan area. Human activities include heavy industry (vessel fabrication at yards along the ship canal), construction associated with replacement for the Evergreen Point floating bridge (state highway 520), and recreational boating and fishing. The ship canal and lake are both mud-bottomed.\r\nAdmiralty Inlet is a relatively narrow constriction at the mouth of Puget Sound. Admiralty Inlet serves as the main route for commercial shipping associated with the ports of Seattle, Everett, and Tacoma and is traversed by a passenger/auto ferry. The ambient noise environment is dominated by vessel traffic at frequencies less than 1 kHz (Bassett et al. 2012) and sediment generated noise at frequencies greater than 1 kHz during periods of strong currents (Bassett et al. 2013). Admiralty Inlet is closed to commercial fishing and this closure is observed by native tribes with Usual & Accustomed treaty rights. Several long-distance telecommunications cables have been laid in Admiralty Inlet and inactive power and communications cables associated with decommissioned coastal fortifications span the inlet between the sites of Fort Worden (Port Townsend), Fort Casey (Admiralty Head), and Fort Flagler (Marrowstone Island). Indian Island, closely adjacent to the inlet, is the site of a Naval Magazine (NAVMAG Indian Island).\r\nBetween Port Townsend and Admiralty Head, the channel is approximately 5 km wide and, on average, 70 m deep. In the Project area associated with deep water testing, the water depth ranges from 50 to 60 m and the seabed is predominantly scoured cobble and gravel, colonized by barnacles, sponges, anemones, and starfish (Greene 2011). Maximum tidal currents can exceed 3.5 m/s and the Sea State is generally below 3 on the Beaufort scale.\r\nIn southern Admiralty Inlet, the channel is also approximately 5 km wide, but the water depth exceeds 100 m in the center of the channel. To the east of Marrowstone Island, were shallow water testing would take place, the water depth ranges from 15-25 m. The seabed is predominantly cobbles, gravel, and shell hash, interspersed with sand. The largest clasts are colonized by barnacles, anemones, and starfish (pers. comm., Jim Thomson). Maximum tidal currents are generally less than 2 m/s and the Sea State is generally below 3 on the Beaufort scale.\r\n________________\r\n5. Effects of the Action\r\nThe effects of DOE\u2019s proposed Action and are discussed in the same order as presented in Section 2.\r\n   3. Testing in a Benign Environment\r\nEnvironmental stresses associated with testing of the AMP in a benign environment include:\r\n* The disturbance of the lake bottom where the docking station is set down (less than 1 m2 of disturbed area on each of up to six occasions),\r\n* The presence of a research vessel in Lake Washington (up to 48 hours in total on six occasions), and\r\n* The presence of the AMP and ROV deployment system in the water column of Lake Washington (up to 48 hours in total on six occasions) or alongside the University of Washington dock adjacent to the ship canal (up to 30 hours in total on five occasions).\r\nThe disturbance of the lake bottom associated with setting down the docking station will be minimal, restricted to less than one square meter of disturbed area where the ballasted frame makes contact. This will result in a short-term, localized increase in turbidity that is unlikely to have an effect on ESA-listed species.\r\nThe deployment and recovery of the AMP is an amalgam of operations associated with launching and recovering an ROV and deploying and recovering a small instrumentation package. The AMP supports a number of passive and active acoustic instruments, as well as a strobe-illuminated camera system, but these will not be powered on during testing and the AMP presence is unlikely to have an effect on ESA-listed species. The ROV is an inspection-class system equipped with cameras and artificial lighting. This model of ROV is similar to those used for benthic habitat and fisheries surveys by state and federal resource agencies (e.g., Packunski et al. 2008) and is unlikely to have an effect on ESA-listed species. The umbilical between the launch platform and surface vessel will the taut and the umbilical between the ROV and launch platform will be moderately taut. The tension in these umbilicals and short-term nature of the deployment minimizes the risk of marine life becoming entangled (or a net becoming entangled around an umbilical). Consequently, neither the umbilicals, nor the launch platform, are likely to have an effect on ESA-listed species.\r\nThere is extensive recreational boating traffic on Lake Washington. For example, when the sockeye salmon fishery is open, there can be up to two thousand small boats on the water in a morning. Additionally, larger vessels transit the lake, such as NOAA vessel mobilizing from facilities at Sand Point, on the western shore of Lake Washington. The presence of one sixty-foot research vessel is unlikely to have any incremental effect on ESA-listed species.\r\nEffects associated with testing in a benign environment are summarized in Table 1.\r\nTable 1 \u2013 Testing effects summary for benign environment\r\nLocation\r\n\tTiming\r\n\tTotal Test Time\r\n\tContinuous Test Time[1]\r\n\tSeabed Disturbance\r\n\tLake Washington\r\n\tApril 2014 \u2013 June 2015\r\n\tUp to 48 hours over six occasions\r\n\t8 hours\r\n\t< 6 m2\r\n\tUniversity of Washington dock\r\n\tApril 2014 \u2013 June 2015\r\n\tUp to 30 hours over six occasions\r\n\t5 hours\r\n\tNone", "tags": ["Relevant tags: ", "Stressor.BehavioralInteraction.Avoidance", "Receptor.Birds", "Receptor.Fish", "Receptor.HumanDimensions.RecreationTourism", "Receptor.Invertebrates", "Receptor.MarineMammals", "Receptor.PhysicalEnvironment.WaterQuality", "Technology.Current", "Technology.Current.Riverine", "Technology.OffshoreWind"]},

Testing in an Adverse Environment\r\nEnvironmental stresses associated with testing of the AMP in an adverse environment are similar to those resulting from testing in a benign environment. The differences, in addition to the environment in which the testing occurs, are:\r\n* Disturbance of a cobble and gravel seabed, rather than a muddy lake bottom\r\n* Shorter duration of testing activities\r\nWhen the docking station is set down, its weight will likely displace cobbles and crush those sessile invertebrates that are in direct contact with the frame. This includes a number of non-ESA listed barnacles, starfish, sponges, and anemones. Recolonization of disturbed areas (< 3 m2 in total) would likely occur within twelve months. The limited extent of the disturbance in a homogeneous benthic habitat suggests that these disturbances are unlikely to have an effect on ESA-listed species.\r\nBecause of the extensive commercial vessel traffic in Admiralty Inlet (quantified by Bassett et al. 2012), the presence of one sixty-foot research vessel is unlikely to have any incremental effect on ESA-listed species.\r\nEffects of testing in an adverse environment are summarized in Table 2.\r\n________________", "tags": ["Phase.3OperationsandMaintenance", "Receptor.Benthos", "Receptor.Habitat.Intertidal", "Receptor.Invertebrates", "Stressor.PhysicalInteraction.DynamicEffects", "Management.Monitoring"]},
